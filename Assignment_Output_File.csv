discipline remain unexplored case articles try explain difference thus becoming primary cause confusion learners hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitionsthen difference ai machine learning statistics data miningthe essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach taken achieve aimsthe aims fields explained detail following sectionsartificial intelligencethe aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities satisfy aim must first understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent answer questions found studying intelligent agents best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror yes humans best examples intelligent entities thus 1900s researchers began exploring thought process reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became aim ai initial years research setting goal studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim turing test turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve humanlevel performance cognitive tasks sufficient fool interrogator test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence intelligence related working human brain without human brain intelligence meaning thus mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim field psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process difference ai tries understand thought process mimic it build it collaboration fields resulted models neural networks try mimic function neurons present human brain so basically initial aim humancentered humans considered ideal intelligent agentconcurrently field computer science developing greater pace advances computer science experiments theories could easily tested validated programs applied solve reallife problems found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans one best examples could

human intelligence ideal intelligenceas computers became advanced proved better humans certain complex tasks new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems so rather considering nature agents researchers began study nature intelligence itself question comes test validate intelligence best way test intelligence solve cognitive problems agent said intelligent solve

approach adopted so humancentered approach computer problemsolving approach two main aims ai fields contributed field giving valuable insightsboth aims important collaboratively form main aim aimachine learningin problemsolving approach big challenge ai overcome order achieve aim consider example solving math problem two cases intelligence tested problemsolving approach let us say two math problems given solve first problem familiar second problem notconsider first problem first problem familiar you means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past so comes question mind able solve problem answer is solved similar problems past thus learned past data solve problems thus even haven’t seen problem past still able solve similar problems one form intelligenceconsider another case given second problem solved kind problems past solve problem try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process second kind intelligencefor ai build intelligent agents kinds intelligence must developed agent but reality ai reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information ai today reached point build agents think own second type intelligenceso way ai able implement first type intelligence machine learning so domain ai focuses solely implementing first kind intelligence fact machine learning reason ml called subset ai so main difference ai mltechnically speaking “it field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions patterns without explicitly programmed” statement needs elaboration essence ml related process “generalization” learning past data generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims consider humans recognize daily life objects see animal easily recognize “dog” “cat” trivial task us ever wondered mind able it answer generalizationif given picture dog easily recognize picture dog because minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts became better better learned past experiences dog so way think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts mindswith generalization only come real “information” so try give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data ownstatisticsthis discipline concerns collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data statistics tries deal data aim explain it so study explaining data itself statistics two main domains descriptive statistics inferential statisticsdescriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name “descriptive” statistics tries explain much information possible easily whole large data would complex task otherwise inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data use inference many tasks daily lives consider simple case cooking soup completing recipe taste small sample is spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad depending upon result sample make inference whole soup soup whole good bad similarly statistics cases apply inference meaningful information example consider case cannot gather whole data timeconsuming costly cases applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty inferential statistics come helpso use data context uncertainty decisionmaking face uncertainty statistics deals with so however whatever data statistics tries explain data aim resonate ai ml statistics help fields correctly interpret datadata mining “data” useful raw form consider examples sensors used industrial applications sensors might used manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature pressure etc raw data generated sensors useful unless converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insights used solve problemdue unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insights data mining also referred “knowledge discovery”
